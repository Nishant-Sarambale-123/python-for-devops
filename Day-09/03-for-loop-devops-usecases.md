Here‚Äôs your **same DevOps ‚Äúfor loop‚Äù use-cases**, exactly as above ‚Äî just converted from **Bash ‚Üí Python** syntax üëá

# üêç **For Loop DevOps Use-Cases (Python Version)**

---

### 1. **Server Provisioning and Configuration**

DevOps engineers use ‚Äúfor‚Äù loops when provisioning multiple servers or virtual machines with the same configuration.
For example, when setting up monitoring agents on multiple servers:

```python
servers = ["server1", "server2", "server3"]

for server in servers:
    configure_monitoring_agent(server)
```

---

### 2. **Deploying Configurations to Multiple Environments**

When deploying configurations to different environments (e.g., development, staging, production), DevOps engineers can use a ‚Äúfor‚Äù loop to apply the same configuration changes to each environment:

```python
environments = ["dev", "staging", "prod"]

for env in environments:
    deploy_configuration(env)
```

---

### 3. **Backup and Restore Operations**

Automating backup and restore operations is a common use case.
DevOps engineers can use ‚Äúfor‚Äù loops to create backups for multiple databases or services and later restore them as needed.

```python
databases = ["db1", "db2", "db3"]

for db in databases:
    create_backup(db)
```

---

### 4. **Log Rotation and Cleanup**

DevOps engineers use ‚Äúfor‚Äù loops to manage log files, rotate logs, and clean up older log files to save disk space.

```python
log_files = ["app.log", "access.log", "error.log"]

for log_file in log_files:
    rotate_and_cleanup_logs(log_file)
```

---

### 5. **Monitoring and Reporting**

In scenarios where you need to gather data or perform checks on multiple systems, a ‚Äúfor‚Äù loop is handy.
For example, monitoring server resources across multiple machines:

```python
servers = ["server1", "server2", "server3"]

for server in servers:
    check_resource_utilization(server)
```

---

### 6. **Managing Cloud Resources**

When working with cloud infrastructure, DevOps engineers can use ‚Äúfor‚Äù loops to manage resources like virtual machines, databases, and storage across different cloud providers.

```python
instances = ["instance1", "instance2", "instance3"]

for instance in instances:
    resize_instance(instance)
```

Would you like me to include **example function definitions** (like `configure_monitoring_agent()`, `create_backup()`, etc.) showing real shell or boto3 commands inside each?
