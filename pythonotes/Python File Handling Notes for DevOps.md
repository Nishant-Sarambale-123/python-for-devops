# üóÇÔ∏è **Python File Handling Notes for DevOps**

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Introduction**

File handling in Python allows you to **read from, write to, and manipulate files**.
This is very useful in DevOps for:

* Parsing **log files**
* Writing **automation scripts**
* Generating **reports**
* Managing **config files**

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Opening a File**

```python
file = open("example.txt", "mode")
```

| Mode   | Description                                    |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `"r"`  | Read (default)                                 |
| `"w"`  | Write (creates new file or truncates existing) |
| `"a"`  | Append (add to end of file)                    |
| `"x"`  | Create new file (fails if exists)              |
| `"rb"` | Read in binary                                 |
| `"wb"` | Write in binary                                |

**Example:**

```python
# Open a file to read
file = open("logs.txt", "r")
print(file.read())
file.close()
```

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Using `with` (Recommended)**

* Automatically closes the file after operations
* Avoids file handle leaks

```python
with open("logs.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
```

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Reading Files**

### a) Read entire file

```python
with open("logs.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
```

### b) Read line by line

```python
with open("logs.txt", "r") as file:
    for line in file:
        print(line.strip())  # strip() removes newline
```

### c) Read into list

```python
with open("logs.txt", "r") as file:
    lines = file.readlines()
    print(lines)  # List of lines
```

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Writing Files**

### a) Write (overwrites existing)

```python
with open("report.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Deployment successful!\n")
```

### b) Append (adds at end)

```python
with open("report.txt", "a") as file:
    file.write("Server restarted at 10:00 PM\n")
```

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ **Practical DevOps Examples**

### Example 1: Parse logs to find errors

```python
with open("app.log", "r") as file:
    for line in file:
        if "ERROR" in line:
            print(line.strip())
```

### Example 2: Write deployment status report

```python
servers = ["web1", "web2", "db1"]
with open("deployment_report.txt", "w") as report:
    for server in servers:
        report.write(f"{server} deployment completed successfully\n")
```

### Example 3: Count lines in a log file

```python
with open("app.log", "r") as file:
    line_count = len(file.readlines())
print(f"Total lines in log: {line_count}")
```

### Example 4: Backup a config file

```python
import shutil
shutil.copy("nginx.conf", "nginx.conf.bak")
print("Backup created successfully")
```

---

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ **File Paths**

* Absolute path: `"C:/Users/DevOps/logs.txt"`
* Relative path: `"logs.txt"` (current folder)

```python
with open(r"C:\logs\app.log", "r") as file:
    print(file.read())
```

---

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ **Working with CSV/Structured Files**

* DevOps often uses CSV or JSON for reports

```python
import csv

# Write CSV
with open("servers.csv", "w", newline="") as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow(["Server", "Status"])
    writer.writerow(["web1", "Up"])
    writer.writerow(["db1", "Down"])

# Read CSV
with open("servers.csv", "r") as file:
    reader = csv.reader(file)
    for row in reader:
        print(row)
```

---

## 9Ô∏è‚É£ **JSON Handling for DevOps Configs**

```python
import json

# Write JSON
servers = {"web1": "up", "db1": "down"}
with open("servers.json", "w") as file:
    json.dump(servers, file, indent=4)

# Read JSON
with open("servers.json", "r") as file:
    data = json.load(file)
    print(data)
```

---

## üîπ **Tips for DevOps**

1. Always use `with open()` to prevent file handle leaks.
2. Use `os` or `shutil` for **file operations like copy, move, delete**.
3. Use `strip()` to remove newline characters when parsing logs.
4. For **large files**, iterate line by line instead of reading the whole file.
5. Combine with **regex** (`re` module) for advanced log parsing.
